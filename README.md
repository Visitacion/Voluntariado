# Voluntariado
This is the repository to define the design of a management platform for voluntary social work and charity.
For this, we will use 4+1 architectural view model. So, we will have the designs documented in the following folders:
- Logical View: with class, object, package, composite structure and state machine diagrams.
- Process View: with sequence, communication, activity, timing and interaction overview diagrams.
- Implementation View: with component diagrams.
- Deployment View: with deployment diagrams.
